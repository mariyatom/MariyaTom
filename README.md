Hi, Iâ€™m Mariya - a **full-stack developer** who speaks both frontend Sass and backend logic. I recently graduated from Dev Academy Aotearoa (Level 6 NZQA), where I dove headfirst into React, databases, and many late-night debugging snacks.

My tech journey started with an Electronics and Communications Engineering degree (Level 7 NZQA). Since then, Iâ€™ve worn many hats  from building a **food ordering system** for St. Pierreâ€™s Sushi in New Zealand (as part of a remote team in India), using Spring Boot, Angular, and MySQL, to modernizing COBOL systems in **Japan** (yes, that dinosaur still roars ðŸ¦–).

Now in Aotearoa, Iâ€™m back in tech with a  fire for creative problem-solving and a passion for building smart solutions.

I love **collaborating** with tech people, brainstorming weird ideas into real things, and turning bugs into features (wellâ€¦ mostly). I'm passionate about building smart, simple digital solutions that make life just a bit easier.

Letâ€™s build cool stuff together.
